# DIY Earthquake Alert System

A DIY **Earthquake Alert System** built with the ESP8266 (NodeMCU / Wemos D1 Mini) and an MPU6050 3-axis accelerometer + gyroscope module.  
The system continuously monitors vibrations, filters noise, and activates both an audible and visual alarm (buzzer + LED) when significant shaking is detected.

## Schematic Diagrams

**Basic Setup:**  

![Schematic Diagram](./img/Schematic_simple.png)

**Solar-Powered Version:**
- **Optional solar-powered version** for backup during power outages

Notes:  
- The onboard LED is tied to **GPIO2 (D4)** on most ESP8266 boards.  
- Use a **passive buzzer** (not active).  
- The MPU6050 requires a clean and stable **3.3 V supply**.
